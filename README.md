# Unity ChatGPT Project

This is a Unity project that uses ChatGPT, a large language model trained by OpenAI, to enable natural language conversations with an AI agent.

## Installation

To use this project, you will need to have Unity (at least 2022.2.12f1) installed on your computer. You can download Unity from the [official website](https://unity.com/).

Once you have Unity installed, you can clone this repository or download the ZIP file and extract it to a folder of your choice.

## Usage

To use the ChatGPT agent, you will need an API key from OpenAI. You can get an API key by [signing up for the OpenAI API](https://beta.openai.com/signup/). Once you have an API key, you can add it to the Unity inspector at --LOGIC-- > Discussion Manager > Api Key and Organization ID.

## Credits

This project uses the [OpenAI API](https://beta.openai.com/) to power the ChatGPT agent.

The project was created by Charles Dorff.
